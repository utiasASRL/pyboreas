# Benchmarks
## Odometry Benchmark
We offer an odometry benchmark for 3D (lidar, camera) and 2D (radar). Our evaluation metric is based on the KITTI odometry benchmark, which computes the relative position and orientation errors over segments of 100 m to 800 m with increments of 100 m.

### File Format
Odometry results for each sequence are to be recorded into a separate `.txt` file and placed in the same directory. The name of each file is the sequence name followed by the `.txt` extension. The devkit contains an example demo with two sequences:
```
ls -1 pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/
boreas-2021-08-05-13-34.txt  
boreas-2021-09-02-11-42.txt
```

The format of each `.txt` file is a space separated `K x 13` table, where `K` is the total number of frames in the sequence, and each row `k` corresponds to the odometry estimate of frame `k`. The first column is the timestamp (64 bit integer) in microseconds. The remaining 12 columns are the upper 3 x 4 block of the SE(3) transformation matrix (64 bit float) in row-aligned order (i.e., the first 4 entries correspond to the first row).

The `k`th row entry is the SE(3) transformation between a stationary reference frame `i` and the `k`th estimated frame of the moving robot. E.g., a transformation `T_k_i` that transforms a homogeneous point in the stationary frame `p_i` to the `k`th robot frame:
```
p_k = T_k_i * p_i
```
The moving robot frame and corresponding timestamps for evaluation depend on whether you are submitting to the 3D benchmark or 2D benchmark.

### Evaluation Frame and Timestamps (3D Benchmark)
Set the moving robot frame to be the `applanix (a)` frame for the 3D benchmark. Set the stationary frame `i` as the first frame of the estimated trajectory. This will make the first row entry of the table `T_a0_a0` (i.e., the identity transformation), the second row will be `T_a1_a0`, the `k`th row will be `T_ak_a0`, and so on.

For the 3D benchmark, provide odometry estimates that **correspond exactly to the `lidar` sensor timestamps**. If your estimator does not output estimates at the `lidar` sensor timestamps, you will need to [interpolate](#interpolation).

#### Example Scenario 1: Lidar Odometry
Report SE(3) pose estimates corresponding to each `lidar` frame timestamp. If your estimator outputs estimates in the `lidar (l)` sensor frame, make sure you transform your estimates to the `applanix (a)` frame, e.g.,
```
T_ak_a0 = T_a_l * T_lk_l0 * T_l_a
```
where `T_a_l` is the extrinsic calibration between the `applanix` frame and `lidar` sensor frame.

#### Example Scenario 2: Visual Odometry (Camera)
You will need to interpolate your pose estimates to match the `lidar` timestamps. Either use an interpolation method of your choice, or apply the interpolation method offered in this devkit. A demo is shown in subsection [`Interpolation`](#interpolation).

Similar to [`Example Scenario 1: Lidar Odometry`](#example-scenario-1-lidar-odometry), make sure to transform your `camera (c)` frame estimates to the `applanix (a)` frame, e.g.,
```
T_ak_a0 = T_a_c * T_ck_c0 * T_c_a
```
where `T_a_c` is the extrinsic calibration between the `applanix` frame and `camera` sensor frame.

### Evaluation Frame and Timestamps (2D Benchmark)
Set the moving robot frame to be the `radar` sensor frame for the 2D benchmark. In other words, nothing needs to be done if your estimator is already reporting results in the `radar` frame. Your odometry estimates will be SE(2) poses, but still report your results as the corresponding SE(3) matrix as shown in [`File Format`](#file-format).

Set the stationary frame `i` as the first frame of the estimated trajectory. Using the `radar (r)` frame, this will make the first row entry of the table `T_r0_r0` (i.e., the identity transformation), the second row will be `T_r1_r0`, the `k`th row will be `T_rk_r0`, and so on.

Provide odometry estimates that **correspond exactly to the `radar` sensor timestamps**.

### Interpolation
If your estimator is not outputing odometry estimates that correspond to the `lidar` sensor timestamps, you will need to interpolate your estimates. A demo of the interpolation script is shown here.

From the root directory, go to the directory `pyboreas`. We can see the arguments of the interpolation script as follows:
```
cd pyboreas
python eval/interpolate.py -h
usage: interpolate.py [-h] [--pred PRED] [--gt GT] [--interp INTERP] [--processes PROCESSES] [--no-solver]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pred PRED           path to prediction files
  --gt GT               path to groundtruth files
  --interp INTERP       path to interpolation output
  --processes PROCESSES
                        number of workers to use for built-in interpolation
  --no-solver           disable solver for built-in interpolation
```
The `pred` argument is the directory containing the odometry sequence files, which is `pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/` for this demo. 

The `gt` argument is for the root directory of your dataset, which should contain the corresponding groundtruth files required for evaluation. For this demo we will use `pyboreas/test/demo/gt/`, but for your use case it should be the root directory of where you stored your data.

The `interp` argument should be set as the output directory for the interpolation files. A `.txt` file for each of your odometry sequences interpolated at the groundtruth (`lidar`) timestamps will be written out to this directory. For this demo, we will output to `pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/interp/`.

The `processes` argument sets the number of processes to use when interpolating. Setting this argument to 1 will result in no additional subprocesses being created. Default value is the CPU count of your machine.

The `no-solver` argument should be included to disable the solver for the built-in interpolation method. We use a batch optimization routine to solve for velocity estimates of each frame in order to interpolate. If the solver is disabled, the script instead interpolates with velocities approximated with finite difference. This is less accurate, but will run much faster. Suggested use is for debugging.

We will interpolate without the solver just for demonstration purposes (run it faster):
```
python eval/interpolate.py --pred test/demo/pred/3d/ --gt test/demo/gt/ --interp test/demo/pred/3d/interp/ --processes 1 --no-solver

boreas-2021-08-05-13-34.txt took 9.404045581817627  seconds
output file: test/demo/pred/3d/interp/boreas-2021-08-05-13-34.txt

output file: test/demo/pred/3d/interp/boreas-2021-09-02-11-42.txt
```
There should now be two new `.txt` files in the `pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/interp/` directory containing the interpolated estimates.

### Local Evaluation
The benchmark evaluation can be run locally for sequences with known groundtruth. Following the [interpolation](#interpolation) demo, we will use the sequences under `pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/`. This evaluation demo requires interpolation, so please first go through the interpolation demo.  

We can see the arguments of the benchmark script as follows:
```
python eval/odometry.py -h
usage: odometry.py [-h] [--pred PRED] [--gt GT] [--radar]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --pred PRED  path to prediction files
  --gt GT      path to groundtruth files
  --radar      evaluate radar odometry in SE(2)
```
The `pred` argument is the directory containing the odometry sequence files, which is `pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/interp/` for this evaluation demo if you followed the interpolation demo correctly.

The `gt` argument is for the root directory of your dataset, which should contain the corresponding groundtruth files required for evaluation. Set this again to `pyboreas/test/demo/gt/` for the demo, but for your use case it should be the root directory of where you stored your data.

The `radar` argument should be included to evaluate the 2D benchmark. The 3D benchmark is run by default. This demo evaluates using the 3D benchmark.


Now to evaluate the interpolated sequences:
```
python eval/odometry.py --pred test/demo/pred/3d/interp/ --gt test/demo/gt/

Overall error:  0.5678934633365106  %,  0.0022963231993319904  deg/m
```
There should now be plots of the odometry path and error for each sequence in the `pred` directory (`pyboreas/test/demo/pred/3d/interp/` for this demo).
